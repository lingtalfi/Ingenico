     * See my directlink-operation-codes-overview.md document for a visual explanation.
     * Basically you have two main options:
     *
     * - RES: to make an authorization only.
     *          The money is not captured by your acquirer (the merchant's bank),
     *          but the acquirer ensures that it will be able to capture the money later.
     *
     *          This code might be useful for instance if you have products that you ship,
     *          and you want to prepare them first, and only capture the money later (another request),
     *          when the goods are sent to the customers.
     *
     * - SAL: to make a direct sale. The transaction is done, and the bank will capture the money
     *          when it treats the transaction (usually just before it closes at 04pm every day).
     *          When the transaction is treated, the money goes to your bank account with a delay
     *          of 24/48h (usually).
     *
     *          This mode is useful for instance if you sell small goods that don't need any preparation,
     *          like for instance concert tickets.
     *
     *
